<p>
This is a blog for recording some technical tips and interesting stuffs I found in daily work.
I used to have a private wiki set up on my workstation. But those kind of things seems to be out of date after I meet static site generator like Jekyll and Nicola. They works perfectly with the github pages.
Feel free to contact me by email.</p>
