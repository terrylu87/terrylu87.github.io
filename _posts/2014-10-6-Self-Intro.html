<h2 id="sec-2">About this blog.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>This is a blog for recording some technical tips and interesting stuffs I found in daily work.
I used to have a private wiki set up on my workstation. But those kind of things seems to be out of date after I meet static site generator like jekyll and nikola. They works perfectly with the github pages.
Feel free to contact me by email.
