* Screen Record
  As a big fan of clash of clans, I want to share some videos of clan battle. When finding the solution under both ios and android. It appears that android has a much easier way with just one command in adb shell.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/filename.mp4
  #+END_SRC
  When you're done, hit CTRL-C to stop recording. The video will be right there.
